## Project Structure

This project contains the following pages:

-   `/simuler`: A page for simulation.
-   `/predire`: A page for prediction.

For the `/simuler` page, we leverage data extracted from our information system along with the current business context to predict potential issues using an advanced AI agent. This AI agent performs a thorough analysis to identify the most probable risks and provides a set of suggested decisions to mitigate these risks.

### Key Features of the `/simuler` Page:

-   **Data Integration**: The page integrates data from various sources within our information system to ensure comprehensive risk analysis.
-   **AI-Driven Predictions**: Utilizes an AI agent to predict potential issues based on the integrated data and current business context.
-   **Decision Suggestions**: The AI agent suggests potential decisions to mitigate identified risks.
-   **User Interaction**: Users can validate or disapprove the suggested decisions.
    -   **Validation**: If the user validates a decision, it is recorded and implemented.
    -   **Disapproval**: If the user disapproves a decision, they must provide a justification.
-   **Continuous Improvement**: The AI agent uses the provided justifications to refine and improve future recommendations, ensuring that the system evolves and becomes more accurate over time.

This approach ensures that our risk management process is both proactive and adaptive, leveraging AI to support informed decision-making and continuous improvement.

### Key Features of the `/reagir` Page:

In case of a real problem, the `/reagir` page provides the following features to ensure effective decision-making and problem resolution:

-   **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Based on all the acquired data, the system helps you determine the best course of action and presents it to the business manager for approval.
-   **AI-Driven Task Automation**: The AI agent can be configured to perform various tasks such as sending emails or contacting clients, which helps save time and streamline operations.
-   **Managerial Support**: The system ensures that the business manager is always informed about the best decisions to take in response to real problems, enhancing overall business efficiency.
-   **Time Efficiency**: By automating routine tasks, the AI agent allows the team to focus on more critical issues, thereby improving productivity and response times.

This approach ensures that the business can react promptly and effectively to real problems, leveraging AI to support informed decision-making and operational efficiency.
